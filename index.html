            I'm Luc Engelen, a freelance, full-stack software engineer and scrum master.
            I've been working independently under the company name cofx since 2022.
            Before that, I worked as a software engineer at various companies, either
            as an employee or a consultant.
            Before that, I worked as a researcher in academia.
            Over the years, I've spent a large amount of time thinking about software,
            writing about software, and creating software.
            I like to think that the quality of my work reflects this.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal as a software engineer is tackling complex problems in the simplest way possible.
            As software grows, maintaining and extending it becomes harder and harder;
            the larger an application becomes, the harder it gets to fully understand it.
            In my experience, keeping things as simple as possible is key to keeping software understandable in the long term,
            which in turns keeps it maintainable and extensible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm satisfied with my work if it achieves its goal, <i>no more, no less</i>, and does this in a straightforward and obvious way.
            But don't be fooled, keeping things simple, straightforward, and obvious is hard work.
            I practise every day.

            Although I have created native Android and iOS apps, most of my

            Apache Cordava.
          </p>
          <p>
            For future projects, I'm keeping an eye on Flutter and ClojureDart.

            Are you looking for an experienced full-stack software developer and scrum master?
            Someone to help out an existing team?
            Someone that can build and deploy a brand new application from start to finish?
            Feel free to get in touch!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm almost fully booked for the rest of 2023.
            However, if you're looking for someone for a small project that would take only a few hours every week,
            I'm open to discuss opportunities.
